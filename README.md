# A Simple Ray Tracer in Rust

An implementation of a basic ray tracing library based on [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and [_Ray Tracing: The Next Week_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingTheNextWeek.html).
I did this project to learn Rust from scratch.
